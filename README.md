# cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance
This terraform module will create an RDS instance and all required AWS resources. A KMS key is also created in order to enable encryption.

The RDS instance that is created uses a randomly generated name to avoid any conflicts. The default database created in the instance uses the same random identifier but can be overriden by the user.

The module also deploys the instance in Multi-AZ.

The outputs of this module should allow a user to connect to the database instance.

## Usage

```hcl
module "example_team_rds" {
  source = "github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance?ref=2.0"

  // The first two inputs are provided by the pipeline for cloud-platform. See the example for more detail.

  cluster_name           = "cloud-platform-live-0"
  cluster_state_bucket   = "live-0-state-bucket"
  db_allocated_storage   = "20"
  db_engine              = "mysql"
  db_engine_version      = "5.7"
  db_instance_class      = "db.t2.small"
  db_retention_period    = 10
  db_storage_type        = "io1"
  db_iops                = "1000"
  team_name              = "example-repo"
  business-unit          = "example-bu"
  application            = "exampleapp"
  is-production          = "false"
  environment-name       = "development"
  infrastructure-support = "example-team@digtal.justice.gov.uk"
}

```

### Tags

Some of the inputs are tags. All infrastructure resources need to be tagged according to MOJ techincal guidence. The tags are stored as variables that you will need to fill out as part of your module.
