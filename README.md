# cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance/all.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance/releases)

This terraform module will create an RDS instance and all required AWS resources. A KMS key is also created in order to enable encryption.

The RDS instance that is created uses a randomly generated name to avoid any conflicts. The default database created in the instance uses the same random identifier but can be overriden by the user.

The module also deploys the instance in Multi-AZ.

The outputs of this module should allow a user to connect to the database instance.

When upgrading the major version of an engine, `allow_major_version_upgrade` must be set to `true`, as default is set to false.

Some engines can't apply some parameters without a reboot(ex postgres9.x cant apply force_ssl immediate), and you will need to specify "pending-reboot" here.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: From version 4.0, this module does not support Live-0 deployment. Be sure to use the previous one (3.1) is you need to deploy to Live-0.**

## Accessing the database

### Database Hostname/Credentials

The hostname and credentials for accessing your database will be in a
kubernetes secret inside your namespace. You can retrieve them as follows (the
`decode.rb` script is available [here][decode]):

```
$ kubectl -n [your namespace] get secret [secret name] -o yaml | ./decode.rb

---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  database_name: ...
  database_password: ...
  database_username: ...
  access_key_id: ...
  secret_access_key: ...
  rds_instance_address: cloud-platform-xxxxx.yyyyy.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
  rds_instance_endpoint: cloud-platform-xxxxx.yyyyy.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432
  rds_instance_port: '5432'
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: '2019-05-08T16:14:23Z'
  name: secret-name
  namespace: your-namespace
  resourceVersion: '11111111'
  selfLink: "/api/v1/namespaces/your-namespace/secrets/secret-name"
  uid: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
type: Opaque
```

If you are exporting a database URL from your RDS kubernetes secret, it might have a value like this:

```
postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37

```

The database hostname is part between `@` and `:` In the example above, the database hostname is:

```
cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
```

### Launching psql in the cluster

A Docker image containing the `psql` utility is available from [Bitnami] (you
cannot use the official postgres image, because it runs as root) and can be
launched like this:

```
$ kubectl -n [your namespace] run --generator=run-pod/v1 shell --rm -i --tty --image bitnami/postgresql -- bash

If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
postgres@shell:/$
```

You can then connect to your database like this

```
postgres@shell:/$ psql -h [rds_instance_address] -U [database_username] [database_name]
Password for username: [...enter database_password here...]
psql (10.7, server 10.6)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
[database_name]=>
```

## Access from outside the cluster

When you create an RDS instance using this module, it is created inside a
virtual private cloud (VPC), which will only accept network connections from
within the kubernetes cluster.  So, trying to connect to the RDS instance from
your local machine will not work.

```
+--------------+                   \ /                        +--------------+
| Your machine | -------------------X-----------------------> | RDS instance |
+--------------+                   / \                        +--------------+
```

If you need to access your database from outside the cluster (e.g. from your
own development machine, or to perform a bulk data import), you can do so via
the following steps:

1. Run a pod inside the cluster to forward network traffic to your RDS instance
2. Tell kubernetes to forward traffic from your local machine to the new pod
3. Access the database as if it were running on your local machine

So, the connection from your machine to the RDS instance works like this:

```
+--------------+             +---------------------+          +--------------+
| Your machine |------------>| Port forwarding pod |--------->| RDS instance |
+--------------+             +---------------------+          +--------------+
```

### 1. Run a port-forward pod

There are several docker images designed to forward network traffic, but you need one which does not run as `root`. We will use [ministryofjustice/port-forward][port-forward-image] for this example.

NB: **The cluster pod security policy (PSP) will prevent any images from running a process as the `root` user, so docker images which expect to do this will not work.**

```
kubectl \
  -n [your namespace] \
  run port-forward-pod \
  --generator=run-pod/v1 \
  --image=ministryofjustice/port-forward \
  --port=5432 \
  --env="REMOTE_HOST=[your database hostname]" \
  --env="LOCAL_PORT=5432" \
  --env="REMOTE_PORT=5432"
```

Note: This creates a pod in your namespace, but without a deployment to manage it. This means that, if the cluster moves your workload to a different node, the port-forward pod will not be moved - it will just disappear. If you need your port-forward pod to persist, please use a [deployment].

### 2. Forward local traffic to the port-forward-pod

Now you need to forward network traffic from a port on your local machine to the port-forward pod inside the cluster.

```
kubectl \
  -n [your namespace] \
  port-forward \
  port-forward-pod 5432:5432
```

You need to leave this running as long as you are accessing the database.

### 3. Access the database

Now you can connect to the database as if it were running locally, on your machine.

If you are exporting a database URL from your RDS kubernetes secret, it might have a value like this:

```
postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37

```

You can use this URL to connect to your database via the port forward you have set up, but you need to replace the database hostname, (`cloud-platform-df3589e0e7acba37.cdwm328dlye6.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com` in this example), with `localhost`.

So, if you were starting from the database URL above, the database connection command you will run on your local machine would be:

```
psql postgres://cpDvquXO5B:R1eDN0xEUnaH6Aqr@localhost:5432/dbdf3589e0e7acba37
```

If you are exporting the database credentials separately, the command would be something like this:

```
psql \
  --host localhost \
  --port 5432 \
  --dbname [your database name] \
  --username [your database username] \
  --password
```

(You will be prompted to enter the database password, which you should get (and then base64 decode) from your kubernetes secret)

Please remember to delete the port-forwarding pod when you have finished.

```
kubectl delete pod port-forward-pod -n [your namespace]
```

### 4. Managing RDS snapshots - backups and restores

An IAM user account is created which allows management of RDS snapshots - allowing snapshot create, delete, copy, restore.

Example usage via AWS CLI:

List snapshots
```
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --db-instance-identifier [db-instance-name]
```

Create snapshot
```
aws rds create-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier [db-instance-name] --db-snapshot-identifier [your-snapshot-name]
```
